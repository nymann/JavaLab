# JavaLab

### Introduction

In this project, the simple Asteroids game from previous project [GamesLab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjNri86r402ZRSZSRauE1R-1A-EKPJdn/view), is
re-factored to use the ServiceLoader available out of box in Java platform Standard Edition.

### Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to:

- Understand the pros and cons of the basic
  ServiceLoader extension mechanism provided by the Java standard platform.
- Understand the primary reason for introducing component interfaces.
- What a whiteboard component model looks like and how to use it.

### Classwork

- **Optionally** follow the steps in [Creating Extensible Applications](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html) and try out [The dictionary example](https://github.com/sweat-tek/SB4-KOM-F20/tree/master/ServiceLoaderExample) to get acquainted with the Java ServiceLoader mechanism.
- Automate the Component Assembly from previous [GamesLab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xjNri86r402ZRSZSRauE1R-1A-EKPJdn/view) using the build-in ServiceLoader in Java (whiteboard component model). A ServiceLoader helper class is provided in here in project [AsteroidsServiceLoader](https://github.com/sweat-tek/SB4-KOM-F20/tree/master/AsteroidsServiceLoader).

### Resources

â€¢ [Java 7 SE ServiceLoader API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
